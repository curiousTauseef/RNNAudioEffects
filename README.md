# RNN Experiments

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/jatinchowdhury18/RNNAudioEffects.svg?token=Ub9niJrqG1Br1qaaxp7E&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/jatinchowdhury18/RNNAudioEffects)

This repository contains code for training and implementing real-time
audio effects using single-sample recurrent neural networks. 

**Effects:**
- [x] Hysteresis
- [ ] Phaser
- [ ] Reverse Distortion
- [ ] Restoration

---

## TODO

### Hysteresis

- Train improved model

### Time-Varying

- Train phaser with param and variable sample rate
- Implement plugin
- Maybe do mod section?

### Reverse Distortion

- Try distortion w/ no gain, or w/ gain applied to dry and wet
- Try with stateful distortion (diode clipper?)
- Add a parameter?
- Implement plugin

### Restoration

- TODO: everything
